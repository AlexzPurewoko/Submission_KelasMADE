      "content": "When it first hit the screen I loved this show. It's rather bare knuckle, vigilante grittiness really broke the candy covered shell, that encases so many comic book hero's.\r\n\r\nSadly in spite of strong stories and mature characterizations for me this show slowly started a downward spiral, gradually exchanging its originality for mainstream complacency. \r\n\r\nWhat really ruined things, in my view, was the migration of the character from a kind of anti hero to a politician. As if this wasn't bad enough, a thread of brittle and downright tiresome, lecturing political correctness crept in too. \r\n\r\nThe result was bland, predictable, opinionated and uninteresting. What a shame. 4/10 from me.",
